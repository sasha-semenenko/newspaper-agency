Allied leaders in Europe and elsewhere are watching nervously to see if the United States will pull back from its leadership of the international coalition backing Ukraine, while analysts say that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is gambling that he can wait out the West.\r\n\r\nMr. Biden has made his support for Ukraine a signature of his foreign policy, arguing that it is vital to American national security to stand up to naked aggression in Europe. American weapons have been critical to Ukraine’s success in resisting Russian forces. But former President Donald J. Trump, who has praised Mr. Putin’s aggression as “genius” and refused to express support for a Ukrainian victory, could make the war a central issue in next year’s election.\r\n\r\n“The president has reaffirmed that we will stand with Ukraine as it defends its sovereignty for as long as it takes, a strategy that has successfully united our allies and partners and equipped Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression,” Shalanda D. Young, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, wrote in a letter to Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California.\r\n\r\nMr. McCarthy said in June that any supplemental appropriation request for Ukraine was “not going anywhere” and that additional aid would have to be worked out in the regular congressional spending process. Seventy House Republicans voted last month to cut off aid to Ukraine altogether.\r\nAlthough that indicates that a bipartisan majority remains in the full House, it was unclear if Mr. McCarthy would defy such a large and vocal segment of his conference to enable the package to get to the floor intact. Mr. McCarthy offered no immediate response to the president’s proposal on Thursday.\r\n\r\nThe request includes $13.1 billion for military aid to Ukraine and replenishment of Pentagon weapons stocks used for the war effort. An additional $8.5 billion would go for economic, humanitarian and other assistance to Ukraine and other countries affected by the war, and $2.3 billion would be used to leverage more aid from other donors through the World Bank.\r\n\r\nCongress has already approved $113 billion in military, economic, humanitarian and other aid for Ukraine, including around $70 billion for security, intelligence and other war fighting costs. Of that total, around 90 percent has already been spent or is already designated to be spent. The United States is by far the largest donor to Ukraine, a point of contention for some critics, although the Council on Foreign Relations has calculated that based on share of economy, it is the 12th largest backer of Ukraine, behind Britain, Poland, Norway and others.\r\n\r\nEditors’ Picks\r\n\r\n5 Places to Bask in Spectacular Foliage This Fall\r\n\r\nImpeachments, #MeToo, Trump: Running The Washington Post During a Decade of Turmoil\r\n\r\nI Was Given a Ring as a Treasured Heirloom. Can I Sell It?\r\nSome conservative critics of Ukraine aid vowed to press Republicans to draw a line. The Heritage Foundation, which has been a leading voice on the right criticizing American help for Ukraine, issued a statement on Thursday insisting that no more money be allocated unless the Biden administration does more to account for what has been spent and articulates “a plan that defines the end goal.”\r\n\r\nDan Caldwell, the vice president of the Center for Renewing America, a right-wing think tank influential among House Republicans and Freedom Caucus members, said Mr. McCarthy should keep his promise not to approve more aid. “Congress should not spend billions more in support of continuing a war in which there are no vital American interests at stake and where there remains a real risk of nuclear escalation,” Mr. Caldwell said.\r\n\r\nSome Freedom Caucus members and their allies quickly responded in kind. “No,” Representative Chip Roy, Republican of Texas and the caucus’s policy director, wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. “This should be a non-starter for the @HouseGOP. It’s time to stand up for Americans and against the uniparty.”\r\n\r\nSupporters of Ukraine said the debate over the spending package could be a critical juncture in the war, sending a message to the Kremlin about American fortitude.\r\n\r\n“The only way Putin can win this war now is for the United States to stop helping Ukraine,” former Representative Tom Malinowski, Democrat of New Jersey, said in an interview. “McCarthy’s going to have to decide whether he wants House Republicans to be blamed for that even though most Republicans in Congress, if given a chance, would vote to keep sending help.”\r\n\r\nMr. Biden sought to sweeten the pot by adding politically popular spending to the Ukraine aid. The supplemental appropriation request includes $12 billion for disaster relief, $4 billion for border security and $60 million for wildland firefighter pay. Democrats cheered money to fight fentanyl trafficking and child labor violations.\r\n\r\nBut the combined request will challenge the spending limits that Mr. Biden negotiated with Mr. McCarthy in May as part of a deal to increase the debt ceiling. Just this week, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the federal government spent $1.6 trillion more than it took in during the first 10 months of the fiscal year, more than twice the shortfall during the same period a year earlier.\r\n\r\nThe politics of Ukraine have changed drastically since the invasion in February 2022. With Mr. Trump leading the way, a number of Republican leaders have questioned American involvement in the war.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump has gone so far as to link future security aid to Ukraine to his efforts to tarnish Mr. Biden at home, much as he did while president in actions that got him impeached. At a rally last month, he said Congress should refuse to send any more weapons until the F.B.I., I.R.S. and Justice Department “hand over every scrap of evidence they have on the Biden crime family’s corrupt business dealings” and threatened to sponsor primary challenges to Republicans who resisted.\r\n\r\nOther Republican presidential candidates, including former Vice President Mike Pence, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina and Nikki R. Haley, the former ambassador to the United Nations, have stood firmly by Ukraine and in some cases criticized Mr. Trump for appeasing Mr. Putin.\r\n\r\nFifty-five percent of Americans now oppose more aid to Ukraine, according to a poll released by CNN last week. The party breakdown is stark — 71 percent of Republicans oppose additional assistance, while 62 percent of Democrats favor it.\r\n\r\nThe White House consulted with key Republicans in Congress before making its request and is counting on help from Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican minority leader. Mr. McConnell has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine and, unlike Mr. Trump and Mr. McCarthy, has pushed Mr. Biden to do more, not less.\r\n\r\n“I look forward to carefully reviewing the administration’s request to make sure it is necessary and appropriate to keep America safe, secure our borders, support our allies and help communities rebuild after disasters,” Mr. McConnell said in response to the spending request.\r\n\r\nIt remains unclear how much influence Mr. McConnell has over Mr. McCarthy, though. To win the speakership in January after 15 arduous rounds of voting, Mr. McCarthy agreed to install three hard-right conservatives on the House Rules Committee, which determines whether bills get on the floor. Even if Mr. McCarthy reverses himself and agrees to put a Ukraine package on the floor, he would have to enlist one of the conservatives or rely on Democratic votes, which he does not want to do.", "published_date": "2023-08-10", "topic": 6, "publishers": [2]}}, {"model": "agency.newspaper", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "Climate change is turning snow to rain and raising risk of floo", "content": "A shift from snow to rain due to climate change is making extreme rainfall and flooding more severe in many parts of the world dominated by snow.\r\n\r\n“We already know global warming increases total precipitation,” says Mohammed Ombadi at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. The atmosphere can hold about 7 per cent more water vapour for each degree Celsius of warming.\r\n\r\nWarmer temperatures are also known to cause more snow to fall as rain. However, it wasn’t clear how this shift from snow to rain contributed to the extreme rainfall events that drive flooding and erosion, which are key factors for designing infrastructure.\r\nOmbadi and his colleagues looked at weather records for the northern hemisphere from 1950 to 2019 to understand patterns of extreme precipitation. They also used climate models to project these patterns under different emissions scenarios.\r\n\r\nIn snowy places such as the Himalayas, the Alps and the Sierra Nevada in the US, they found the intensity of extreme rainfall increased by an average of 15 per cent for each degree Celsius of warming, more than twice the global average increase. Based on historical data and on modelling, they found that the shift from snow to rain is the main factor behind the increased extremes.\r\n“We are already seeing that in the data,” says Ombadi. He points to the flooding in California this year and the devastating floods in Pakistan in 2022 as examples where more rain in the mountains may have played a role in flooding downstream.\r\n\r\nFrances Davenport at Colorado State University says her research has found rain-driven floods in some regions were more than twice as large as floods driven by snow that melted on the ground, though the link between rainfall and flood risk is complex. “We’re still in a climate where we get both snow and rain, and the fraction can vary a lot,” she says.\r\n\r\nJouni Räisänen at the University of Helsinki in Finland adds that the effect might appear less pronounced if viewed in proportion to local increases in temperature, rather than global averages, since the temperature rises over land tend to be higher.

Here’s What Happens Next.", "content": "Violent crime — homicides, robberies, gun assaults — has begun to fall from pandemic-era levels. But people are scared. According to the Pew Research Center, almost 60 percent of Americans today say that violent crime is a “very big problem.” In New York State, four out of ten residents tell pollsters they’ve “never been this worried about my personal safety.”\r\n\r\nRepublican politicians have been amping up these fears, blaming the violence on soft-on-crime policies and the “defund the police” movement, which they accuse Democrats of supporting. Democratic politicians have been pointing out that crime rates are actually low, relative to their peak in the early 1990s.\r\n\r\nYet social scientists have long been aware of a paradox that doesn’t fit well with either narrative: Fear of crime itself may make public safety worse.\r\n\r\nConsider guns. The desire for protection is one of the main reasons people buy them. Yet having a gun around not only increases the risk of suicide and accidental shootings, it can also contribute to a community’s crime problems.\r\n\r\nThe economist Stephen Billings looked at residents of Charlotte, N.C. and the surrounding county who received concealed-carry permits. He found that during the year he tracked them, people who had a permit were no less likely to be victims of violent crime than people who didn’t have one. But the concealed carriers were substantially more likely to report being the victim of a property crime — and what the criminals often took was one of their guns.\r\n\r\nStolen guns are sometimes trafficked out of state but more commonly circulate locally, where they may be used to commit additional offenses. As a result, each concealed-carry permit increased the violent crime rate in the neighborhood by about 2 percent. (Dr. Billings noted that if the owners had simply practiced better gun safety, such an increase would have been blunted.) Guns that wind up in the wrong hands also make crime more lethal.\r\n\r\nBecause of the combination of permissive legislation, recent court rulings that undercut gun control and aggressive manufacturing and marketing, firearms are easier to come by than ever. If fear of crime leads more people to get guns and some of those guns are then stolen, increasing violence and creating more fear, a vicious cycle could ensue. Even if this cycle doesn’t lead to a major uptick in the overall rate of crime, it can create a floor below which crime rates wouldn’t fall — as Charlotte and other cities may be experiencing now, primarily because of guns that were stolen from cars.\r\n\r\nFear can also make crime more likely by fraying the social and economic fabric. Decades of social science research shows that people tend to overestimate their chances of becoming victims, that they may wrongly infer that an area is dangerous from seeing individuals engage in disorderly behavior and that fear of crime sometimes reflects underlying racial or ethnic prejudice. In a classic 1986 essay, the political scientist Wesley Skogan argued that when people become afraid of criminal activity in a neighborhood for these or other reasons, conditions can rapidly worsen.\r\n\r\nPeople who are scared might stop socializing as much with their neighbors. They might become less active in houses of worship or as volunteers with civic organizations, sapping the strength of vital neighborhood institutions. They may no longer feel safe banding together to urge troublemakers on the street to move along, abandoning the informal social control necessary to keep further crime in check.\r\n\r\nEditors’ Picks\r\n\r\n5 Places to Bask in Spectacular Foliage This Fall\r\n\r\nImpeachments, #MeToo, Trump: Running The Washington Post During a Decade of Turmoil\r\n\r\nI Was Given a Ring as a Treasured Heirloom. Can I Sell It?\r\nAnd as people become reluctant to shop or work in an area, retail stores will close and manufacturers and offices will relocate. With less legal income flowing into the community, illicit markets grow, bringing more theft, drugs and violence.\r\n\r\nDr. Skogan’s focus was residential neighborhoods, but those lessons are directly relevant to downtown areas, too — especially right now. Hanna Love and Tracy Hadden Loh of the Brookings Institution wrote this spring on the situation facing downtowns in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Seattle. In all four cities, downtown districts haven’t fully recovered from the pandemic, when many office workers went remote. Office vacancy rates remain high and businesses that serve office workers are languishing or have shut down. Meanwhile, individuals struggling with homelessness, visible mental illness or addiction seem more numerous, and accounts of theft and violence abound.\r\n\r\nIn interviews the researchers conducted with business owners, commuters, downtown residents and public officials, concerns about crime were top of mind, cited as the main factor “stopping workers from coming back to the office.” Yet when Ms. Love and Dr. Loh examined crime statistics in these cities, they found a mismatch. Though citywide crime rates had gone up, most of the increase had occurred in disadvantaged residential areas. Downtowns were less affected than people believed.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, a disturbing pattern was emerging. Calls were mounting for cities to direct resources, including law enforcement and social services, toward business districts as a way to revive them. But those resources alone wouldn’t do it — and diverting them from the parts of the city where they were needed most would make a difficult situation in those areas worse.\r\n\r\nFinally, when people are scared of crime, politicians pressure the police to crack down. Contrary to what some progressives think, increasing the police presence in an area does tend to lower the crime rate. But indiscriminate, heavy-handed crackdowns — reliance on blanket stop-and-frisk tactics, for example — erode community trust, hampering police officers’ ability to conduct investigations. Crimes go unsolved and criminals remain free to strike again.\r\n\r\nPerhaps counterintuitively, research shows that surging police patrols may increase fear of crime: Residents take them as a signal that the danger must be really severe. In addition, last year about half of Black Americans said they would rather be robbed or burglarized than have unprovoked contact with the police, according to one study. Both facts could explain why in New York, where Mayor Eric Adams beefed up police patrols on the subway, many riders continue to express fears even as transit crimes in most categories have dipped to prepandemic levels.\r\n\r\nThe solution to all this is not to keep insisting that crime isn’t as bad as people think. Fear doesn’t respond well to data. Besides, while over-the-top fears may not be justified in most cases, the public safety situation in the United States does warrant concern.\r\n\r\nThere are no easy fixes, but it’s hard to see a meaningful response to crime that doesn’t include strengthening the social safety net, increasing the certainty of punishment for serious offenses, working toward common-sense gun control and helping individuals and families cope with trauma and other mental health challenges. To bolster trust, we also need to improve policing, focusing as much on changing the culture of the occupation as on imposing stricter laws and policies.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, one of the best things that cities can do to reduce fear is to increase social connections among residents. Studies show that the more ties people have to one another in their communities, the less fearful they are of becoming crime victims, perhaps because they know they can count on others for protection and support or because other people may keep our fears in perspective. While fear can chip away at those ties, government, nonprofits and the private sector can all play a role in fortifying what the sociologist Eric Klinenberg has called the “social infrastructure” of cities. Community centers, recreational facilities, libraries, cultural events and neighborhood organizations connect us to one another, making everyday life feel a little less scary.", "published_date": "2023-08-01", "topic": 3, "publishers": [3]}}, {"model": "agency.newspaper", "pk": 4, "fields": {"title": "The Louvre - Famous Museum in the Heart of Paris", "content": "The Louvre is one of the most famous museums in the world.

Since intangible assets have no shape or form, they cannot be held or manipulated. Common types of intangible assets include brands, goodwill, and intellectual property. Businesses have several ways to value these assets, which can be challenging because they have no shape or form. They are in contrast to tangible assets, which have physical forms and can be held.\r\nAs noted above, an intangible asset is one that has no physical form. As such, it cannot be handled. These assets are generally considered long-term whose value increases over time. Even though it doesn't have a physical form, an intangible asset can be very valuable for the owner and critical to their long-term success (or failure).\r\n\r\nIntangible assets are commonly held by businesses. They may include brand recognition, goodwill, and intellectual property like patents, trademarks, and copyrights. These assets can be divided into two categories:\r\n\r\nIndefinite: This type of intangible asset stays with the holder as long as it continues to operate, such as a brand name.\r\nDefinite: This type is restricted to a limited time. A legal agreement to operate under another company's patent with no plans of extending the agreement is considered a definite intangible asset.\r\nBusinesses can create or acquire intangible assets. For example, a business may create a mailing list of clients or establish a patent. If a business creates an intangible asset, it can write off the expenses from the process, such as filing the patent application, hiring a lawyer, and paying other related costs.\r\nBrands\r\nA brand is something that sets one business apart from another. This may come in the form of a logo, symbol, or brand name. Businesses commonly use marketing, design techniques, and advertising to come up with their brands. This allows consumers to easily identify a particular company. For instance, most people can easily identify Apple (AAPL) just by seeing its logo.\r\n\r\nBrands are important because they contribute to a company's brand equity and help keep customers loyal. Some consumers may choose to ignore pricing and pay more for one company's product out of loyalty even if it is priced higher than a similar product offered by a competitor. Consider athletes who choose Nike over Adidas and vice versa.\r\n\r\nGoodwill\r\nWhen one company purchases another, the intangible assets associated with that transaction are considered goodwill. When a company acquires another business, any amount that exceeds the fair value of the target's net assets represents its goodwill. If the amount is above the target's book value, then it results in positive goodwill. Anything below book value is negative goodwill.\r\nIntellectual Property\r\nIntellectual property is a type of intangible asset that is legally protected. This means it cannot be used by another business or individual unless authorized by the owner. Common forms of intellectual property include:\r\nCopyrights\r\nDigital Assets\r\nFranchises\r\nPatents\r\nTrademarks\r\nTrade Secrets\r\nAny unauthorized use of someone else's intellectual property is called infringement. This includes using (intentionally or unintentionally), mimicking, or copying another entity's brand name, logo, or other assets.\r\n\r\nHow to Value Intangible Assets \r\nA business like Coca-Cola (KO) wouldn't be nearly as successful if not for the money made through brand recognition. Although brand recognition is not a physical asset that can be seen or touched, it can have a meaningful impact on generating sales. So how does a company value intangible assets like this one?\r\nThere are generally three ways that businesses can value their intangible assets, according to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). They are the:\r\n\r\nMarket Approach: This valuation relies on an expected value based on a relative analysis. It focuses on placing a value on similar intangible assets. It may prove to be difficult because of the limited details available about similar assets held by other companies.\r\nIncome Approach: Companies can use this method when their intangible assets have a cash flow stream. Some income approaches include the relief from royalty method, which estimates possible royalty payments derived from the use of the asset or the avoided loss of income.\r\nCost Approach: This method relies on the idea of substitution and doesn't account for any future benefits based on time or amount.\r\n4\r\nAll the expenses of creating intangible assets are expensed. But intangible assets created by a company do not appear on the balance sheet and have no recorded book value. Because of this, when a company is purchased, often the purchase price is above the book value of assets on the balance sheet. The purchasing company records the premium paid as an intangible asset on its balance sheet.\r\n5\r\n\r\nIntangible vs. Tangible Assets\r\nAs noted above, tangible assets are the opposite of intangible ones. They have a physical form, which means they can be held and manipulated. These are among the main assets that a company has in its portfolio.\r\n\r\nUnlike intangible assets, the value of tangible assets may be easier to determine. The owner may choose to hire an appraiser who determines the fair market value (FMV) of the asset or they may decide to sell the asset for cash. Another common form of valuation is by comparing it to the cost of a replacement.\r\n\r\nSome of the most common forms of tangible assets include:\r\n\r\nEquipment\r\nFurniture\r\nInventory\r\nLand\r\nProperty\r\nVehicles\r\nFinancial securities, such as stocks and bonds, are also considered tangible assets even though they can't be held. That's because they derive their value from contractual claims.\r\n6\r\n\r\nTangible assets come in two categories: current and fixed. Current assets are those that can be easily used and converted to cash, such as inventory. Fixed assets, on the other hand, are tangible assets that have a lifespan of one year or more. Plant, property, and equipment (PP&E) is considered a fixed asset.\r\nExample of Intangible Assets\r\nIntangible assets only appear on the balance sheet if they have been acquired. If Company ABC purchases a patent from Company XYZ for an agreed-upon amount of $1 billion, then Company ABC would record a transaction for $1 billion in intangible assets that would appear under long-term assets.\r\n\r\nThe $1 billion asset would then be written off over a number of years via amortization. Indefinite life intangible assets, such as goodwill, are not amortized. Rather, these assets are assessed each year for impairment, which is when the carrying value exceeds the asset's fair value.\r\n2\r\n\r\nWhat Are the Main Types of Intangible Assets?\r\nIntangible assets fall into two different categories: definite, which last for a certain period of time, and indefinite, which have an infinite lifespan. The types of intangible assets include brands, goodwill, and intellectual property.\r\n\r\nWhat's the Difference Between Intangible and Tangible Assets?\r\nIntangible assets have no physical shape or form. This means they can't be handled. Tangible assets, on the other hand, have a physical shape, which means they can be handled and grasped.

Like many religions, Bitcoin even has dietary restrictions associated with it.\r\n\r\nReligion’s dirty secret\r\nSo does Bitcoin’s having prophets, evangelists and dietary laws make it a religion or not?\r\nAs a scholar of religion, I think this is the wrong question to ask.\r\n\r\nThe dirty secret of religious studies is that there is no universal definition of what religion is. Traditions such as Christianity, Islam and Buddhism certainly exist and have similarities, but the idea that these are all examples of religion is relatively new.\r\n\r\nThe word “religion” as it’s used today – a vague category that includes certain cultural ideas and practices related to God, the afterlife or morality – arose in Europe around the 16th century. Before this, many Europeans understood that there were only three types of people in the world: Christians, Jews and heathens.\r\n\r\nThis model shifted after the Protestant Reformation when a long series of wars began between Catholics and Protestants. These became known as “wars of religion,” and religion became a way of talking about differences between Christians. At the same time, Europeans were encountering other cultures through exploration and colonialism. Some of the traditions they encountered shared certain similarities to Christianity and were also deemed religions.\r\n\r\nNon-European languages have historically not had a direct equivalent to the word “religion.” What has counted as religion has changed over the centuries, and there are always political interests at stake in determining whether or not something is a religion.\r\n\r\nAs religion scholar Russell McCutcheon argues, “The interesting thing to study, then, is not what religion is or is not, but ‘the making of it’ process itself – whether that manufacturing activity takes place in a courtroom or is a claim made by a group about their own behaviors and institutions.”\r\n\r\nCritics highlight irrationality\r\nWith this in mind, why would anyone claim that Bitcoin is a religion?\r\n\r\nSome commentators seem to be making this claim to steer investors away from Bitcoin. Emerging market fund manager Mark Mobius, in an attempt to tamp down enthusiasm about cryptocurrency, said that “crypto is a religion, not an investment.”\r\n\r\nHis statement, however, is an example of a false dichotomy fallacy, or the assumption that if something is one thing, it cannot be another. There is no reason that a religion cannot also be an investment, a political system or nearly anything else.\r\n\r\nMobius’ point, though, is that “religion,” like cryptocurrency, is irrational. This criticism of religion has been around since the Enlightenment, when Voltaire wrote, “Nothing can be more contrary to religion and the clergy than reason and common sense.”\r\n\r\nIn this case, labeling Bitcoin a “religion” suggests that bitcoin investors are fanatics and not making rational choices.\r\n\r\nBitcoin as good and wholesome\r\nOn the other hand, some Bitcoin proponents have leaned into the religion label. McCook’s articles use the language of religion to highlight certain aspects of Bitcoin culture and to normalize them.\r\n\r\nFor example, “stacking sats” – the practice of regularly buying small fractions of bitcoins – sounds weird. But McCook refers to this practice as a religious ritual, and more specifically as “tithing.” Many churches practice tithing, in which members make regular donations to support their church. So this comparison makes sat stacking seem more familiar.\r\n\r\nWhile for some people religion may be associated with the irrational, it is also associated with what religion scholar Doug Cowan calls “the good, moral and decent fallacy.” That is, some people often assume if something is really a religion, it must represent something good. People who “stack sats” might sound weird. But people who “tithe” could sound principled and wholesome.\r\nUsing religion as a framework\r\nFor religion scholars, categorizing something as a religion can pave the way for new insights.\r\n\r\nAs religion scholar J.Z. Smith writes, “‘Religion’ is not a native term; it is created by scholars for their intellectual purposes and therefore is theirs to define.” For Smith, categorizing certain traditions or cultural institutions as religions creates a comparative framework that will hopefully result in some new understanding. With this in mind, comparing Bitcoin to a tradition like Christianity may cause people to notice things that they didn’t before.\r\n\r\nFor example, many religions were founded by charismatic leaders. Charismatic authority does not come from any government office or tradition but solely from the relationship between a leader and their followers. Charismatic leaders are seen by their followers as superhuman or at least extraordinary. Because this relationship is precarious, leaders often remain aloof to keep followers from seeing them as ordinary human beings.\r\n\r\nSeveral commentators have noted that Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto resembles a sort of prophet. Nakamoto’s true identity – or whether Nakamoto is actually a team of people – remains a mystery. But the intrigue surrounding this figure is a source of charisma with consequences for bitcoin’s economic value. Many who invest in bitcoin do so in part because they regard Nakamoto as a genius and an economic rebel. In Budapest, artists even erected a bronze statue as a tribute to Nakamoto.\r\nThere’s also a connection between Bitcoin and millennialism, or the belief in a coming collective salvation for a select group of people.\r\n\r\nIn Christianity, millennial expectations involve the return of Jesus and the final judgment of the living and the dead. Some Bitcoiners believe in an inevitable coming “hyperbitcoinization” in which bitcoin will be the only valid currency. When this happens, the “Bitcoin believers” who invested will be justified, while the “no coiners” who shunned cryptocurrency will lose everything.\r\n\r\nA path to salvation\r\nFinally, some Bitcoiners view bitcoin as not just a way to make money, but as the answer to all of humanity’s problems.\r\n\r\n“Because the root cause of all of our problems is basically money printing and capital misallocation as a result of that,” McCook argues, “the only way the whales are going to be saved, or the trees are going to be saved, or the kids are going to be saved, is if we just stop the degeneracy.”\r\n\r\n[Explore the intersection of faith, politics, arts and culture.

In his book “God Is Not One,” religion professor Stephen Prothero highlights the distinctiveness of world religions using a four-point model, in which each tradition identifies a unique problem with the human condition, posits a solution, offers specific practices to achieve the solution and puts forth exemplars to model that path.\r\n\r\nThis model can be applied to Bitcoin: The problem is fiat currency, the solution is Bitcoin, and the practices include encouraging others to invest, “stacking sats” and “hodling” – refusing to sell bitcoin to keep its value up. The exemplars include Satoshi and other figures involved in the creation of blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nSo does this comparison prove that Bitcoin is a religion?\r\n\r\nNot necessarily, because theologians, sociologists and legal theorists have many different definitions of religion, all of which are more or less useful depending on what the definition is being used for.\r\n\r\nHowever, this comparison may help people understand why Bitcoin has become so attractive to so many people, in ways that would not be possible if Bitcoin were approached as a purely economic phenomenon.", "published_date": "2023-08-09", "topic": 8, "publishers": [6]}}]
